;;; Commentary:

;;; Code:

;; TODO: With an eye on performance it is probably a good idea if the
;;     Reporter, Source and Sink are all global rather than buffer local.
;;     It's not so much the instantiation of the objects themselves that's
;;     expensive, rather it's the fact that now all the thread locals need
;;     to do their own de/serialization, and it takes time to transfer Msg
;;     objects into/out of Elisp.
